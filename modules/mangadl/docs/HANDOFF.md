# mangadl Immediate Project Handoff

Active branch: `agent/add-manga18fx-backend`, based on `agent/add-development-ledger-module`.

Current version: `mangadl 1.11.0`.

Implemented scope includes the native Manga18FX backend; destination-aware resume; bounded inner image concurrency; safe/staggered outer workers; runtime concurrency controls; cumulative native progress; aligned two-row dashboard output; concise `run`, `optimize`, `benchmark`, and nested `config` command surfaces; online adaptive optimization and systematic benchmarking; and an interactive archive browser.

The user confirmed live Manga18FX downloads and approximately 15-17 MiB/s aggregate throughput with four outer workers. A fifth outer worker saturates the current destination disk and remains outside the safe default ceiling.

The full Windows pytest suite has not yet run against 1.11.0. Merge into `main` remains unauthorized until tests, one bounded live optimize/benchmark run, resume-only progress, and archive browsing are validated locally.
