Implemented scope includes the native Manga18FX backend; destination-aware resume; bounded inner image concurrency; safe/staggered outer workers; runtime concurrency controls; cumulative native progress; aligned two-row dashboard output; concise `run`, `optimize`, `benchmark`, and nested `config` command surfaces; online adaptive optimization and systematic benchmarking; and an interactive archive browser.

The user confirmed live Manga18FX downloads and approximately 15-17 MiB/s aggregate throughput with four outer workers. A fifth outer worker saturates the current destination disk and remains outside the safe default ceiling.

The pre-existing Manga18FX local validation notes remain historical. Generic
managed gallery-dl authentication S1-S4 is implemented and validated on this
feature branch. S5 corrected the global naming override, embedded gallery-dl
errors, HTTP retry classification, and concurrent partial-merge race exposed
by the first real multi-URL run. Version 1.14.1 passes 146 tests; one-worker and
four-worker live Mangakakalot downloads now complete with distinct images.
