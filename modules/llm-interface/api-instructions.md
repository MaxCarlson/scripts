I need you to look through every folder in this current folder (eaxh fokder is a pgtbon module if it has a pyproject.toml file). for each module read all of its oython files (no meed for tests unless afyer reading all other .py files you still dont understand it). then inside each modules folder, write an API_DOC.md file. this file should be written with the understanding that its purpose is to allow an llm given the file complete understandkng of how to use the python module (function and class names and signstures, etc.). the API_DOC.md file is meant to replace the need for me to pass thr entire modules contents to an llm for it to understamd and write cods thay uses that module.
if you could also write an API_CREATION.md document in this folder first ehich explains to a future llm how to do the task im asking you to do now, and the why i just explained.
modules to process first: cross_platform, 
then i want you to write a python script that can parse these created API_DOC.md files (as they should be written in a format thats consistent enough a python script can parse them to determine if a class or function or file foujd in one of the files is within its api doc,or not,or if the function or class has chsnged). the py script should parse an api doc and then the modules files and output a report showing which functions or classes or files are missing from the existing report, and outoutting shich classes or functions are changed between the api and cureent files. then output stats about what % of classes and functions are missing/changed between the report and the current files (counting xlasses and functions in files not covered by the api doc).
firstly thoigu, copy and erite this message word for word to api-instructions.md (new file).
