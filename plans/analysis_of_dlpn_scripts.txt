# Analysis of downloads_dlpn/scripts/

## High-Level Summary

The scripts in this directory are primarily focused on media downloading/processing and system/file monitoring. There is a significant opportunity to consolidate the various downloader scripts into a single, powerful, and extensible `media-dl` project. Additionally, the file scanning script (`scan_by_date.py`) heavily overlaps with existing file utilities, reinforcing the need for the previously recommended `filekit` tool.

### 1. Merge `scan_by_date.py` into the `filekit` Project

**Observation:**
The script `scan_by_date.py` is a powerful file-finding and listing tool. Its core function is nearly identical to that of `pyscripts/folder_stats.py` and `pyscripts/file_kit.py`.

**Recommendation:**
- **Consolidate:** Merge the functionality of all three scripts into the `pyscripts/file_kit.py` tool, which already has a good subcommand structure.
- **Integrate Features:** Port the date-based filtering (`--older-than`, `--newer-than`) from `scan_by_date.py` into `file_kit.py`.
- **Standardize UI:** Deprecate the `curses`-based TUI from `scan_by_date.py` and standardize on the `rich` library already used by the other tools.
- **Deprecate:** Remove `scan_by_date.py` and `folder_stats.py` after merging.

### 2. Create a Unified `media-dl` Project

**Observation:**
There are multiple, highly capable scripts for downloading media: `aebndl_dlpn.py`, `roundrr.py`, `roundrobin_ytdlp.py`, and others in `pscripts/video`.

**Recommendation:**
- **Create `pyprjs/media-dl`:** Establish a new project to serve as a centralized framework for all media downloading.
- **Adopt a Plugin Architecture:** Use a core parallel runner (from `roundrobin_ytdlp.py`) and create downloader "plugins" or configs for different services (yt-dlp, aebndl, manifest extraction).
- **Integrate Existing Logic:** Move the logic from the various downloader scripts into this new, unified project.

### 3. Create a `video-tools` Project

**Observation:**
Scripts like `video_cleaner.py`, `video_processor.py`, and `pyscripts/edit_video_file.py` are all for post-download video processing.

**Recommendation:**
- **Create `pyprjs/video-tools`:** Consolidate all video manipulation logic into a single project.
- **Use Subcommands:** Implement features like `process`, `clean-names`, and `clip` as subcommands for a clean user interface.

### 4. Relocate Standalone Utilities

- **`ProcessManager.py`:** This is a well-defined utility. It should become its own project (`pyprjs/proc-manager`) or be integrated into the `system_tools` module.
- **`proc_stats.py` & `shortest.py`:** These monitoring scripts could become part of the new `video-tools` project or a separate `sys-monitor` tool.
- **`randomize_urls.py`:** This is a small utility that could be a helper function within the `media-dl` project.
