# Analysis of nhentai-dl and manga-mgmt

## High-Level Summary

These two directories represent two distinct but related domains: downloading manga (`nhentai-dl`) and post-download processing using AI/ML (`manga-mgmt`). They should be organized into two separate, focused projects. The `manga-mgmt` directory contains a very powerful, reusable `model_manager` that could eventually become a shared module.

### 1. `nhentai-dl` -> Integrate into `media-dl` Project

**Observation:**
The `nhentai-dl` directory contains scripts (`dlnh.py`, `dlnhv2.py`) that are wrappers around an external `nhentai` CLI tool. This is a specialized downloading task.

**Recommendation:**
- **Merge into `media-dl`:** This functionality belongs in the previously proposed `pyprjs/media-dl` project.
- **Create a "nhentai" Downloader:** The logic should be encapsulated as a specific downloader module within the `media-dl` framework. This would allow the parallel runner to process nhentai URLs alongside others.
- **Consolidate and Deprecate:** The two Python scripts (`dlnh.py`, `dlnhv2.py`) should be merged into one, and the `nhentai-dl` directory should be removed once the logic is migrated.

### 2. `manga-mgmt` -> Create New `manga-analyzer` Project

**Observation:**
The `manga-mgmt` directory contains a suite of advanced tools for processing manga, including OCR, summarization, and tag generation using local LLMs. This is a complex application, not just a simple script or module.

**Recommendation:**
- **Create `pyprjs/manga-analyzer`:** This functionality is a perfect candidate for a new, dedicated project.
- **Migrate Core Logic:** Move `manga-mgmt/summarize-manga.py`, `manga-mgmt/quantize-manga.py`, and the `model_manager/` subdirectory into the new `pyprjs/manga-analyzer` project.
- **Relocate Scraper:** The `scrape-nhentai-tags.py` script is for data acquisition, not analysis. It should be moved into the `media-dl` project, as its purpose is to gather information from the source. The `poptags.json` file it generates can be considered a shared artifact consumed by the `manga-analyzer`.
- **Promote `model_manager` (Future):** The `model_manager` is a highly reusable utility for managing local LLMs. For now, it can live inside the `manga-analyzer` project. If any other projects require LLM management in the future, it should be promoted to its own top-level module (e.g., `modules/llm_manager`).
